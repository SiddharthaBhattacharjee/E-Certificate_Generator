# Instructions
## Here is how you can use this genertor, it's very simple to use:

1) Get your design created and paste it in the *designs* folder.
2) Get your data in the form of .xlsx (microsoft excel) or .csv (Google sheets) format, it should contain only 1 row containing the names alone.
3) Start the generator.
4) Set the name of your output folder (make sure the name is unique and valid)
5) Select your data file from the list by entering its corresponding number in the console (type enter after you type the number in)
6) repeat step 5 for your design as well.
7) Wait while python works for you, it might take a while if the dataset is huge.
